### Problem 2

``` r
accel_df =
read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
pivot_longer(
  activity.1 : activity.1440,
    names_to = "activity",
    values_to = "minutes"
) %>% 
mutate(
  weekday=case_when(
day %in% c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday") ~ "weekday",
day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday") ~ "weekend"
),
day = factor(day),
day = forcats::fct_relevel(day, c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday")),
weekday = as.factor(weekday) 
)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
head(accel_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 6
    ##    week day_id day    activity   minutes weekday
    ##   <dbl>  <dbl> <fct>  <chr>        <dbl> <fct>  
    ## 1     1      1 Friday activity.1    88.4 weekday
    ## 2     1      1 Friday activity.2    82.2 weekday
    ## 3     1      1 Friday activity.3    64.4 weekday
    ## 4     1      1 Friday activity.4    70.0 weekday
    ## 5     1      1 Friday activity.5    75.0 weekday
    ## 6     1      1 Friday activity.6    66.3 weekday

``` r
count(accel_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1 50400

There are 6 variables in the cleaned dataset: week, day\_id, day,
activity, minutes, weekday. This dataset contains 50400 rows and 6
columns. There are 50400 observations. The variables “week”, “day\_id”
and “minutes”are double datat ype. “day” and “weekday” are factor datat
ype. “activity” is character data ype.

``` r
accel_df %>% 
group_by(week, day, weekday) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(minutes)) %>% 
    knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week', 'day' (override with `.groups` argument)
